# BCD_Decade_Counter

Description : When the Decade counter is at REST, the count is equal to 0000. This is first stage of the counter cycle. 
When we connect a clock signal input to the counter circuit, then the circuit will count the binary sequence.
The first clock pulse can make the circuit to count up to 9 (1001). The next clock pulse advances to count 10 (1010).
